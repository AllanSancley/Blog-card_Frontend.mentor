### What I learned

My main learning in this challenge was in the CSS the use of “line-height” spacing between lines and “letter-spacing” between words to make it as close as possible to the drawing, and also the shading around the card using “box- shadow”

See the code snippet below:

```css{
    line-height: 1.5em;
    letter-spacing: 0.1px;
```

```css{
    box-shadow: 8px 8px black;
```

- [Article 2](https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/docs/Web/CSS/letter-spacing) - This helped with the use of the "letter-spacing" element. I recommend reading it for anyone who is a beginner.
- [Article 3](https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow) - It helped me with the shading around the card.
